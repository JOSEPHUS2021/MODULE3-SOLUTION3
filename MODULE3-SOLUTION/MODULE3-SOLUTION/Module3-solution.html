		<div id="content-p1" class="fooditem">Chicken Tikka</div>
			<p id="p1">Tandoori and Chicken Tikka are almost the exact same with one exception, Tikka generally refers to boneless marinated Chicken while Tandoori has the bone in and can be any part of the Chicken. Once you change the meat or make it with Vegetables they are the same, marinated in yoghurt and spices and cooked in a Tandoor Oven.

				Chicken tikka masala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish.

				However, in very general terms, tikka masala is a tomato and cream-based sauce with a lot of spices added. It's slightly spicy and tastes earthy. The chicken has a chargrilled flavor that pairs perfectly with the creamy sauce.

				Beef Kababb
			</div>
			 <p id="p1">Relatively tender, without a need for extensive marinating, Sirloin (from top to tip) is lean and fits into a balanced diet – plus, it's budget-friendly . Other good beef choices for kabobs are Flat Iron or Strip Steak and even Tenderloin.

       Mix the beef, cumin, paprika, salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper together in a bowl. Divide the mince mixture into 8 portions and press each portion firmly onto flat skewers, each one around 10–12cm/4–4½in long. Place a non-stick griddle pan over a high heat and brush with a little oil.

       Gravy beef is a cut that comes from three main areas; the hind leg and the front leg (also known as shin) plus the neck area. It is rich in flavour and is traditionally used with the bone in for excellent stews and soups.

		Sushi Vegetables
	</div>
		<p id="p1">Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.

			Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.
